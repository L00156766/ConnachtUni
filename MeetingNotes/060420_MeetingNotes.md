- Phani went over a demo on Elastic beanstalk + CI/CD.
*elastic beanstalk*
- First topic was to go over Elastic beanstalk as it can help stand up environments in minutes.
- Elastic beanstalk - prepackaged software that will install what's needed using cloudFormation. It creates an application with all the typical features (monitoring, alerts, etc).
- It will also create load balancing and auto-scaling capabilities automatically
- In the demo - there were two EC2 instances created through the elastic beanstalk wizard
- Once the application was created - there were various options to configure - such as instance types, number of instances, software, capacity, monitoring

*code pipeline CI/CD*
