# Tech Stack Analysis

A technology stack combines the frameworks and programming languages needed for web and mobile app development. While no two tech stacks are identical, most app developers combine two different “arenas” when defining a tech stack: client-side (front-end) and server-side (back-end).

| client-side                                        | server-side                              |

| Angular framework                                               | Database: MySQL as recommended                                       |
|                                      | Web Server: Apache   |                                      |
|                                      | OS: Linux   |                                      |
|                                      | Python   |                                      |
                                                     |
