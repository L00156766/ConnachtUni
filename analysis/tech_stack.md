# Tech Stack Recommendation

A technology stack combines the frameworks and programming languages needed for web and mobile app development. While no two tech stacks are identical, most app developers combine two different “arenas” when defining a tech stack: client-side (front-end) and server-side (back-end).

| client-side          | server-side                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Angular framework    | Database: MySQL as recommended           |
|                      | Web Server: Apache                       |
|                      | OS: Linux                                |
|                      | Python                                   |

## Conclusion
Matthew recommends the Augular framework for front end development because it will easily lets us use HTML as the template language for the UI and lets developers and page authors extend HTML's syntax to express an application's components clearly and succinctly. Even non-developers should be able to use Angular to write web pages and connect those pages to back-end business funcationality easily.  Angular's data binding and dependency injection eliminates much of the code we would otherwise have to write which will speed development.
